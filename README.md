# week 8

In this week, we made significant strides in our project. In the modeling phase, we successfully developed our model and designed twin-screw wheels to optimize the space between the battery and circuit board, along with their connecting components. Our product is a twin-screw amphibious robot. Market research revealed gaps in existing products in the market, and we've identified innovative solutions to address these shortcomings. Notably, our research indicated that while there are various amphibious robots available, the utilization of spiral transmission is relatively limited. This insight guides our project's uniqueness and potential market advantage.

In addition, we conducted an in-depth analysis of the Battery Energy Management System. We performed a discharge test to measure the State of Charge (SoC) of the battery, and we developed a method for estimating the state of charge for lithium-ion batteries under various ambient temperatures. Specifically, we employed the Cubature Kalman Filter (CKF) algorithm based on Truncated Singular Value Decomposition (TSVD) for accurate SoC estimation. This advanced approach ensures efficient energy management, enhancing the overall performance of our system.
